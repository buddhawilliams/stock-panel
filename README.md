scheb/stock-panel
=================

I've written this Symfony application for myself to keep track of my stock portfolio.

It uses my [Yahoo Finance API](https://github.com/scheb/yahoo-finance-api) to fetch current quotes and calculates profit
and loss from it.

## Requirements

- PHP8.1

## Installation

1) Configure `.env` file.
2) Execute commands:

```
composer install
```
